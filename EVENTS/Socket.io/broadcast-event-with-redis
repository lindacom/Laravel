Broadcast with Redis
=====================

Using Laravel's event broadcasting

1. Create a socket.js file and add all server, socketio etc details
2. In Laravel create an event - php artisan make: event <name>
3. In the config > broadcasting.php file change default driver to Redis
3. Open the new app > events > <name> file. Extend event and implement ShouldBroadcast.  Add a public variable

N.b. only public properties will be serialised for broadcast

```
class <name> extends Event implements ShouldBroadcase
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

    public $username;
    /**
     * Create a new event instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct($username)
    {
        $this->username = $username;
    }

    /**
     * Get the channels the event should broadcast on.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel|array
     */
    public function broadcastOn()
    {
        return new PrivateChannel('channel-name');
    }
}
```

4. run node socket.js
