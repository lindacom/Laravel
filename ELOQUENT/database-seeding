You can create dummy records in your database table using database seeding.  

1. Create a database table
2. Create a model
3. Create a factory
4. Create a table seeder

In the database > seeds directory you will see a file caled DatabaseSeeder.php.  This is the main file that controls any other seeding file. The files are referenced in the
run method of this file.

Create a seed file
--------------------
Create a new file in the database > seeds directory
In the file enter code for creating a factory in the run method  - factory('App\User', 50)->create



Create seed records
-------------------

run the command php artisan db:seed 
records should ow be added to the database using settings from the file located in databae > factories 

N.b. you can create an associative array in the factory method in the seed file to overrise the defaults in the factory file.
