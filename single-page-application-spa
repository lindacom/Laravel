Single page application using Vue.js
=====================================

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data.

1. In visual studio code create a new project - laravel new <name>. Open the folder and open a new terminal.
2. Install NPM dependencies into the project - npm install.  This creates a node_modules folder in the project.
3. The Bootstrap and Vue scaffolding provided by Laravel is located in the laravel/ui Composer package

install laravel/ui using Composer - composer require laravel/ui
install the frontend scaffolding - php artisan ui vue
install bootstrap scaffolding = php artisan ui bootstrap
Generate login / registration scaffolding - php artisan ui vue --auth

run "npm install && npm run dev" to compile your fresh scaffolding

4. Pull in Vue Router (see router.vuejs.org) - npm install vue-router
5. In the resources > js > app.js file:

import vue - import Vue from 'vue';
Import routes - import routes from './routes';
import vue router - import VueRouter from 'vue-router'; 

install vue router as a plugin - Vue.use(VueRouter); 

In the vue instance add a router new VueRouter.

```
const app = new Vue({
    el: '#app';

    router: new VueRouter(routes)

});
```

6. In the resources > js directory create a new routes.js file and add the path and components for the routes e.g.

```
export default {
    node: 'history',

    routes: [
        {
            path: '/',
            component: Home
        },

        {
            path: '/about',
            component: About
        }
    ]
};
```

7. In the resources > js > components folder create the components (e.g. home.vue, about.vue).
8. In the routes.js file import the components (i.e. import Home from './components/Home';)
9. In the resources > views > welcome.blade.php file 

load a div with an id app (this is bound to the view element in the app.js file) 
Within this div use a router-vie element <router-view></router-view>
Within this div add router links which when clicked accesses the components in the same page  <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
      

import the /js/app.js file in a script tag.
10. Run the command npm run watch to listen out for changes to the files
11. Run the command php artisan serve and click the link to view the project in the browser.

N.b. because we are only using one page to display various routes we need to specify a wildcard in the web.php file for the root url

12. In the routes > web.php file edit the get route for the welcome view

```
Route::get('/{any?}', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```
