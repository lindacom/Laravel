Single page application using Vue.js
=====================================

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data.

Set up the environment
------------------------
1. In visual studio code create a new project - laravel new <name>. Open the folder and open a new terminal.
2. Install NPM dependencies into the project - npm install.  This creates a node_modules folder in the project.
3. The Bootstrap and Vue scaffolding provided by Laravel is located in the laravel/ui Composer package

install laravel/ui using Composer - composer require laravel/ui
install the frontend scaffolding - php artisan ui vue
install bootstrap scaffolding = php artisan ui bootstrap
Generate login / registration scaffolding - php artisan ui vue --auth

run "npm install && npm run dev" to compile your fresh scaffolding

Routing
---------

1. Create a web route for the one main page - In the routes > web.php file edit the get route for the welcome view.

```
Route::get('/{any?}', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

2. Create the vue files that will be pulled in by routes - In the resources > js > components folder create the components (e.g. home.vue, about.vue).
3. Install Vue Router (see router.vuejs.org) - npm install vue-router
4. Import vue router in the resources > assets > js > bootstrap.js file - import vue router - import VueRouter from 'vue-router'; 
5. Create a routes.js file to list all the single page application routes. 

import the components (i.e. import Home from './components/Home';)

Export a new instance of vue router that will contain route dtails. 

In the vue instance add a router new VueRouter:

```
const app = new Vue({
    el: '#app';

    router: new VueRouter(routes)

});
```
6. Define routes - In the resources > js directory create a new routes.js file and add the path and components for the routes e.g.

```
export default {
    node: 'history',

    routes: [
        {
            path: '/',
            component: Home
        },

        {
            path: '/about',
            component: About
        }
    ]
};
```

7. In resources > assets > js > app.js file import router. - import router from './routes'; and pass it to the vue intance

```
new Vue ({
el: '#app',
router
});

Display routes
---------------
 
8. In the resources > views > welcome.blade.php file you can now use the router-link tog for links and router-view tag for content

load a div with an id app (this is bound to the view element in the app.js file) 
Within this div use a router-vie element <router-view></router-view>
Within this div add router links which when clicked accesses the components in the same page  <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
      

import the /js/app.js file in a script tag.

9. Run the command npm run watch to listen out for changes to the files
10. Run the command php artisan serve and click the link to view the project in the browser.

N.b. because we are only using one page to display various routes we need to specify a wildcard in the web.php file for the root url

Vue filters
=============

In the component define a filter that accepts an argumet then in the methods you can format it

```
filters: {
age(date) {
return moment(dat).fromNow();
}
}

In the view file use the pie symol to referene the filter that the previous string should be sent through. N.b. you can use as many filters as you need

{{ status.created_at | age }}
